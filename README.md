# portal-sandbox
A sandbox for thinking with &lt;portal&gt;

Uses the new `<portal>` tag ([proposed spec](https://wicg.github.io/portals/)) that is currently only supported by [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/).

- [Stuart Langridge: You really don't need all that JavaScript, I promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV9Pem71mJ8) My introduction to `<portal>`s was from a newer version of this talk at [GOTO Conf 2020](https://gotochgo.com/2020/)
